# Risk Agent
Risky Business will design and implement an artificially intelligent method to play the table-top game called Risk. The project will be complete once the described agent can play Risk well and/or better than an expert player. We are doing this for those Risk players who feel that the AI's out there are not a real challenge and for those new players who want to play a Risk game as if they were playing it with their friends.
## Code Example
***TODO***
## Motivation
We felt that the current AI methods out there were not hard enough. This is due to the fact that they are all strategie based; given enough time and resources, one could predict how any given algorithm was to behave. We also felt that new players who do not have the time or friends to play with a group needed a good way to learn good strategies. In this endevaur we decided it best to implement our own AI in Risk.
