                             Risk LuxDelux Notes
     All agents inherit from an interface called LuxAgent. This interface allows
for any given implementation of a Risk agent. The agent can behave differently
given the phase it is needed to act in. These phases are:
      1. Attacking Phase (void attackPhase())
      	 a. Called at start of attack phase
	 b. Attacking is done by calling one of Board's attack() methods
	    i. Look at Board's attack() methods.
      2. Cards Phase (void cardsPhase(Card[] cards))
      	 a. Called at the start of agent's turn.
	 b. The parameter is an array of your cards.
	 c. If you want to cash a set of cards in, the agent should call
	   (board.cashCards(Card, Card, Card))
	    i. You can call it repeatedly
	 d. If the agent ever returns the Cards Phase with more than 5 cards,
	   they will be automatically setted to bring you under.
      3. Fortify Phase (void fortifyPhase())
      	 a. Last phase of turn is fortifying your armies.
	 b. *Each Country has a moveableArmies variable. Right before the board
	    *calls your fortifyPhase method, it will set each Country's variable
	    *equal to that Country's number of armies. Every time you fortify
	    *from a country the variable will be decremented to a minimum of 0.
	 c. Should use board.fortifyArmies(int, int, int) to actually move.

     There are also a couple different types of methods that determine strategy
and behaviour:
      1. Movement of Armies (int moveArmiesIn(int, int))
      	 a. Called when a country is taken over.
	 b. must return the number of armies to move into the new country
	 c. Minimum acceptable answer is the number of attack dice you used.
	 d. Maximum acceptable answer is the number of armies left in the attacking
	    country minus 1.
	 e. Will be rounded to either maximum or minimum if out of bounds
      2. Picking Countries (int pickCountry())
      	 a. Only called if preferences are set to allow players to select countries
      3. Placement of Armies (void placeArmies(int))
      	 a. Determines where to put armies received at beginning of turn.
	 b. Should call board.placeArmies(int, int)
      4. Placing Initial Armies
      	 a. Determines where to put armies recieved at beginning of game.
     
     There are also other required methods, but these methods would be the same
every time for the agent (mostly version numbers and other things). Now that we
have seen how the agents are defined, let's look at a couple examples of different
agents. These are separated into three different groups based on how well they
perform against other agents. These categories are Easy, Medium, and Hard.
      1. Easy
      	 a. Angry
	    i. Picking Countries
	       A. Tries to get the countries in the smallest continents, prefferably
	       	  empty.
	       B. Of those countries picked in A, it will then pick the country that
	       	  has the most neighbors that it owns.
	    ii. Placing Initial Armies
	       A. Does the same as placing any normal armies
	    iii. Chards Phase
	       A. Will only use cards if the amount of cards in your hand goes over
	       	  5.
 	    iv. Placement of Armies
	       A. Puts all of its armies where they can attack the most countries.
	    v. Attack Phase
	       A. Will attack until it has lost a battle (a. k. a. it has not toops
	          left to fight with)
	       B. Calculates the weakest enemy and fights it only if it has more
	          troops than they do.
	    vi. 
	 b. Communist
	 c. Stinky
      2. Medium
      	 a. Cluster
	 b. Pixie
	 c. Shaft
	 d. Yakool
      3. Hard
      	 a. Boscoe
	 b. EvilPixie
	 c. Killbot
	 d. Quo
